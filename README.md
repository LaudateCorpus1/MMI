Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure
===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PowerShell/MMI.svg?token=31YifM4jfyVpBmEGitCm&branch=johnkord-mmi_changes)](https://travis-ci.com/PowerShell/MMI)

This repo contains the `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure` source code (and
soon tests). This is a dependency of PowerShell, but is kept separate.

Build with `./build.sh` (it runs two commands which can be run by hand).

Test with `./test.sh` (it runs one command which can also be run by hand).
